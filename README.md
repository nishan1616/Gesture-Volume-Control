# Gesture Volume Control Project

[Source Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY&t=10330s)

The repository is mainly built upon MediaPipe, OpenCV and Pycaw. While MediaPipe offers a number of functionalities to perform hand tracking, OpenCV helps users to interact with these models. Pycaw library lets users get and set volume level.

This repo lets users set volume levels automatically with the modulation of distance between index finger and thumb just by opening and closing them. Here is a demo picture from the project:
